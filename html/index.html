          Some sites charge a dollar or more for just one sound.
          SoundKit give you 300 high quality sounds for just $18.
          That’s less than six cents per sound. We think this sounds like a pretty good thing.

        <h3>About SoundKit</h3>
      </div>
      <div id="soundkit-background">
        <p>SoundKit was imagined and created in Atlanta, Georiga at Dunk Tank. Dunk Tank is a creative design studio
           disciplined in everything from sound design to animation and creative strategy. All sounds we’re recorded,
           designed, and mixed in the Dunk Tank studios.</p>

        <p>After mixing, all sounds were professionally mastered for consistency and quality at Jump The Shark Studios
           by sound engineer Jay Wallace.</p>

        <p>Each file has been broken up into a category for ease of use. We encourage you to experiement with sounds
           in new and unique ways. Our categories are just guides to get you started.</p>

        <p>We hope you enjoy using SoundKit as much as we enjoyed creating it. Please share with us how you use the
           sounds. We always welcome feedback and questions at beepboop@soundkit.io.</p>
