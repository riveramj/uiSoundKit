<p>Let’s all be adults here. We want you to get the most out of the SoundKit royalty free sound effects library.

<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</strong></p>
Use sounds for personal and commercial projects
Use sounds for yourself or on behalf of a client
Upload/Embed sounds into project files and code accessible by others

<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN’T DO:</strong></p>
<p>Resell, sublicense, repackage, or distribute sounds on their own</p>
<p>Give the sounds to your buddies when no one is looking</p>
<p>Leap tall buildings in a  single bound</p>
