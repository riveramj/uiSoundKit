  <p><strong>SoundKit Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit’s Privacy Policy is designed to help users of SoundKit’s web site understand how SoundKit collects and uses the personal information users decide to share and to help users make informed decisions when using the SoundKit web site (the "Site").</p>
  <p>By using or accessing the Site, you are accepting SoundKit's practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>If you have questions regarding SoundKit's Privacy Policy, please use our contact link to send us an e-mail.</p>
  <p><strong>The Information SoundKit Collects</strong></p>
  <p>When you visit the Site, you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Site.</p>
  <p>When you purchase a product through SoundKit, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your e-mail address, your location, and any other personal or preference information that you choose to share with us.</p>
  <p>When you enter the Site, SoundKit collects your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Site visitors. In addition, SoundKit stores certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. SoundKit uses session ID cookies for several purposes, including to confirm that users are logged in. SoundKit uses a persistent cookie that stores information to make it easier for you to login when you come back to the Site. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature. </p>
  <p>Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the Site is a violation of the SoundKit Terms of Service and should be reported by using our contact form to send us an e-mail.</p>
  <p>By using the Site, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
  <p><strong>Children Under Age 13</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to purchase products. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to purchase SoundKit products or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Site. In the event that SoundKit learns that SoundKit has collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, SoundKit will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that SoundKit might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us by using our contact form to send us an e-mail.</p>
  <p><strong>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit recommends that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending over the Internet to SoundKit or anyone any information about themselves.</p>
  <p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by SoundKit</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Site. Generally, you may opt out of such e-mails, although SoundKit reserves the right to send you notices about the Services (as defined in the SoundKit Terms of Service) and your account even if you opt out of all voluntary e-mail notifications.</p>
  <p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. SoundKit does not reveal information until SoundKit has a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, SoundKit may share account or other information when SoundKit believes it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Site or using the SoundKit name or to prevent imminent bodily harm. These uses may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
  <p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the SoundKit business, or individual business units owned by SoundKit were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the Services can continue. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p><strong>Links</strong></p>
  <p>The Site may contain links to other websites. SoundKit is not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. SoundKit encourages our users to be aware when they leave our Site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. SoundKit's Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by SoundKit.</p>
  <p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
  <p>SOUNDKIT'S PRIVACY POLICY COVERS THE USE OF COOKIES BY THE SITE AND DOES NOT COVER THE USE OF COOKIES OR OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES BY ANY OF ITS ADVERTISERS.</p>
  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>SoundKit takes appropriate security precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number), SoundKit encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, SoundKit requests that you not send private information to us by e-mail or instant messaging services.</p>
  <p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong></p>
  <p>Your use of the Site, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Service and all of its dispute resolution provisions, including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. SoundKit reserves the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on the Site. If SoundKit makes changes, SoundKit will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If SoundKit makes material changes to this Privacy Policy, SoundKit will notify you here, by e-mail, or through notice on our home page. SoundKit encourages you to refer to this Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand how SoundKit handles your personal information. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that SoundKit has about you and your account.</p>
